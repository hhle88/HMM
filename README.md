In this project we would like to deal with training HMM for isolated digits data applying EM algorithm. The testing phase is also considered using Viterbi algorithm. The results showed the performances which obtained by Matlab programming are similar to HTK's ones.
In this project we have not prepared data files (.mfcc files) yet, please do it by yourself with your own data. Then, you may need to change some code in the file "generate_trainingfile_list.m" and "generate_testingfile_list.m" up to your data file paths.
Please run the file "EM_HMM_isolated_digit_main.m" to start.
